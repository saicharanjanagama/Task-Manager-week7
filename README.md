  A simple and interactive <b>Task Manager Application</b> built as part of my 
  <b>Week 7 Internship Project</b>.  
  It supports full <b>CRUD operations</b> — Create, Read, Update, Delete — with state management using 
  <b>Redux Toolkit</b> and optional persistence using browser <b>LocalStorage</b>.  
  Everything is handled on the client-side with React components and styled-components.
